The goal of our project was to make a turn based rpg style game where you could defeat the enemy! Our future hopes for this project would be incorporating all characters and even multiplayer functionality. Items and potions along with healing abilities and ultimates would
be a nice touch as well. We would also develop more than one creature to kill and possibly create stages like a normal rpg turn based game.

Taylor Darnell handled the back end database and worked with fellow students on the front end design.
